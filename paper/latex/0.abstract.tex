Current exponential growth of traffic congestion has proven a major challenge in terms of safety, both in cities and roads alike. Traffic accidents is one of the main death cause worldwide, many efforts are being made in order to reduce it. From a preventive standpoint, traffic control becomes essential not only to make streets and roads safer, but also to make transportation more fluid. In this work, we present a robust and real-time road traffic monitoring system using a regular video camera mounted on a relatively high place. The work is divided in four stages: video stabilization, background modeling and foreground segmentation, vehicle tracking and speed estimation. The system deals with lighting changes and multi-modal distributions caused by elements like tree branches or shadows, and it is able to quickly recover from occlusions and track loss. It has been proven to track vehicles successfully in three different real traffic sequences, with distinct cameras and lightning conditions.
